{Talk about what the three different categories are, and how they can be differentiated from each other.  (this should be about 2 paragraphs).  
Then talk about what commonalities each category has with the others(this can be again 1-2 paragraphs) }

{The term text reduction is intended as a broad category which encompasses three distinct tasks: text compression, text simplification, and multi-document text paraphrasing.  The three tasks all share a common goal of reducing a text from it's original form into a more manageable and useful format suited to a specific need.   In the case of text compression, texts are reduced in order to improve reading times,\citet{bla} or to adapt text to smaller devices\citet{bla}. For Text simplification, the goal may be to reduce a text's complexity for children\citet{bla}.or those with reading imparements \citet{bla}.  It has also been recently used for improving medical document information retrieval \citet{bla}. In the case of mulit-document text paraphrasing,  systems are  designed to reduce text from multiple sources in order to create an abstractive summary.\citet{bla}.}

\t{Because of the diverse end goals a researcher may be aiming for, each of the three tasks (compression, simplification, paraphrasing) approach the goal of transforming the source text in a different manner. In the task of text compression, a reduced text is one in which the total number of words is reduced, while still preserving the important information and retaining grammaticality.  In the task of text simplification, a reduced text would be semantically and/or syntactically less complex, and may also be reduced in length (though this is not a necessary condition).  In the task of paraphrasing, a collection of texts is searched for equivalent sentences which represent important information. From thes sentences an abstractive summary can be generated by fusing pieces of these sentences together.
Over the course of this paper I will highlight the commonalities and differences among these tasks, and focus special attention on how discourse information has been used in each task.}








\subsection{Goals}
{Here talk about the Goals of each category, and how that has come about over the course of research on the subject}

\subsection{Approaches}
{Talk about the way that the problems are modeled for each category of text reduction. Then talk about some of the algorithms (and possibly machine learning paradigms) used to solve the tasks of compression, simplification, and paraphrasing.  When there is overlap point it out, and also make note of when there are drastically diverging. }


\subsection{Data}

{Highlight the kind of data used to train and/or model the problem for each text reduction task. Is the data directly used to train a system, or is it simply used as a frame of reference for un-supervised learning.  What kind of data is used for validation and evaluating the systems? }

\subsection{Use of Discourse Information}
{Go into depth about what systems make use of Discourse level informaiton, either directly in processing of the text, or perhaps in a more limited aspect in the evaluation of the output.  Also mention versions of text reduction that do not make use of any Discourse information.  Are they any better?  Is discourse information at this point not terribly helpful to solving the task?}

\subsection{Natbib citations}
Within a text, you can say that \citet{lin2001} found out something. Or you can just state the thing, and then put the author in parentheses \citep[see][]{szpektor2004}.
