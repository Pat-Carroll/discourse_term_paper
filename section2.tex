\section{Compression Related Tasks}


\subsection{Text Compression}
{The system that I am presenting from \citep{}

{In order to arrive at suitable constraints for deletion, several approaches have been proposed. One example from \citep{Knight:2002:SBS:604203.604207} models compression as a translation from a verbose sentence to a sparse one. In this approach the noisy channel model is used to find the most likely compression out of a set of many possible compressions. In the paper by \citet{Clarke:2010:DCD:1950488.1950493} which I will be covering in section 2, the authors re-imagines the task as an optimization problem:  Given a string of text, retain the words which maximize a scoring function.  The scoring function is series of competing constraints, including rules about enforcing grammaticality, keeping text to a certain length, and retaining informative words based on sentence and discourse level information.
